	<h5 class="heading">Why do sea turtles eat plastic?</h5>
	<h2>Plastic bags look very similar to jellyfish, fishing nets often look like tasty seaweed. Sea turtles think they are consuming some of their staple foods when really they are welcoming harmful substances into their digestive tract. Human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered, and plastic is doing more than its share of damage.However, it's not just ingesting plastic that causes problems for turtles. Entanglement in abandoned fishing nets can easily kill them through drowning or preventing individuals from escaping predators or hunting.Tragically, the accumulation of plastics at key nesting beaches means that baby turtles are among the most at risk from plastic entanglement, preventing them from reaching the sea.</h2>

	<h5 class="heading2">What does plastic pollution do to sea turtles?<h5>
	<h2>Ingesting plastics is not a harmless mistake, the consumption of this man-made material can cost sea turtles their lives. That is because plastic can cause blockages in their intestines and even pierce the intestinal wall causing internal bleeding.Perhaps the most distressing fate of all is when the plastic in the turtle's stomach imitates the sensation of being full. Turtles then neglect to seek out other food sources and ultimately die from starvation.Sadly, it is not only the consumption of plastic that poses a threat to these marine reptiles, when turtles get entangled in plastic debris they risk choking to death, losing limbs and generally injuring themselves (sometimes beyond repair).The fishing industry is a serious threat in itself. While turtles are strong swimmers they often become entangled in fishing gear, and once weighted down they are unable to surface and subsequently drown.</h2>

	<h5 class="heading3">Facts about the Turtes!</h5>
	<h2> * Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world - beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!</h2>
	<h2> * These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago - woah!</h2>
	<h2> * Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators - some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!</h2>
	<h2> * Just like your bones, a turtle's shell is actually part of its skeleton. It's made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle's rib cage and spine.</h2>
	<h2> * Contrary to popular belief, a turtle cannot come out of its shell. The turtle's shell grows with them, so it's impossible for them to grow too big for it!</h2>
	<h2> * Sadly, many species of turtle are endangered! 129 of approximately 300 species of turtle and tortoise on Earth today are either vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, according to the IUCN. Threats include loss of habitat, poaching and the illegal pet trade.</h2>
