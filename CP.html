<h2> These Sea Turtles need your help! They are sturggling to survive in the sea. STOP DRINKING PLASTICS STRAWS. DO NOT use plastic objects that can go int he ocean. Baby turtles aren't able to be fully developed and live a fullfilling life because of the trash and platic in the Ocean. I chose this topic because I may be the cause of this problem. I do not like to harm any human or animal. I use plastics and starws everyday from fast food places. It makes me sad to see these sea trutles in destressed like this. Sea truteles are harmless. All they do is swim and eat like everyone else. I am interested in Sea turtles because it is an anmial I know people do not eat. I see turtles in movies all the time. Especially Finding Nemo and Finding Dory. They travel as a family and soon they won't be able to because many sea turtles are dieing off from Humans and are actions. For example this sea turtle was rescued on the New Jersey coast, she weighed under 75 pounds.  Now that might not sound bad, but when you're supposed to end up around 250 pounds as a grown-up, that's not good. Also not good - her rear flippers were paralyzed, she had curvature of the spine, and her shell was broken, cracked with one piece missing altogether.  That not only left her vulnerable out in the wild, but meant that as she grew, her shell would become deformed, which could eventually be just as dangerous. But Overtime she got better and she grew properly. As you can see sea turtles can become healed again but to prevent them from groing thorugh this process we need to STOP DRINKING PLASTICS STRAWS. Come join my campaign today and help these sea turtles.   </h2>
